## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

The team plans on meeting at least once a week. We want to meet in person, as we feel that it allows for more clear, direct communication. Each meeting will be between 45 - 90 mins. As an alternative, we’ll use Microsoft Teams to meet when team members are unable to meet in person. For both the online, and in-person meetings, each team member is responsible for taking notes.

2. **Assistance**
We will utilize email as well as Discord in order to properly communicate with each other. When working on our assigned tasks for a given week, we will actively check our email as well as Discord in order to ensure clear communication and assist one another when needed. We have established that a clear response rate is within 3-4 hours from when a message was sent. We decided that 3-4 hours is a fair amount of time due to classes and other tasks. 
 

3. **Respect** 
In order to maintain respect within the group, we will make sure to allow open communication. We will make it clear that asking each other questions is welcome and encouraged. In order to see success within the group, we will ensure that each member is able to give their input by ensuring that we review each other’s GitHub commits. We will assign reviewers to our commits to allow each member on the team to be able to comment and review our contributions. We will also meet in person as much as possible to allow for communication and to be able to easily give feedback and ask questions. 

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
We plan on storing out the distribution for the work during every weekly meeting. When unforeseen obstacles occur that hinder a team member's ability to complete their work that week, our team is prepared to step up and pick up that work for that team member. This is possible because we’re all friends. We will most definitely try to distribute the work so that we play to each other's strengths.


5. **Time Commitment** 
We anticipate allocating around 10 hours per week at a minimum in order to effectively produce a well-rounded project. Prior commitments that need to be accounted for are each other’s classes, clubs, family commitments, and more. In order to work around these commitments we will communicate effectively in order to find time that works for everyone. When new conflicts occur we will work around them and make sure to be accommodating to one another. Additionally, we will set times to meet throughout the work ahead of time in order to have designated time to work ahead of the week. This way, if a conflict occurs, we can note if that interferes with our designated time and if so we can find a new time accordingly. 

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
In order to resolve any team conflicts, we will always make sure we have open communication. If a member does not complete their assigned task, we will all reach out to the team member who is not completing the task. If the team member does not complete the task, we will make it clear that the member will not get credit for the weekly task if they do not contribute. Since all four of us are friends, we will contact each other directly to resolve any issues with communication, though we do not anticipate these issues will arise due to our group dynamic. We will firstly communicate within the group, if any larger issues arise we will reach out to course staff.
